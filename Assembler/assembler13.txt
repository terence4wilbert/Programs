; Problem x –  Write a program in GMS assembly language that places -1 (0xFF) 
;in exactly 16 memory locations beginning at Data.  Data should be located at 0x40. 
;This should be accomplished with a count-controlled loop NOT an address comparison

; Code
           org 0x00 ; ALL programs are to have the first executable
                    ; instruction loaded into address 0X00
